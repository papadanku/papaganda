ReShade Shaders
"""""""""""""""

:Date: 2020 - Present
:Link: https://github.com/papadanku/CShade

I created **CShade**, a library of image and video processing shaders, which includes:

- **AMD FidelityFX ports**

  - `FidelityFX Lens <https://gpuopen.com/manuals/fidelityfx_sdk/fidelityfx_sdk-page_techniques_lens/>`_
  - `FidelityFX Contrast Adaptive Sharpening \(CAS\) <https://gpuopen.com/manuals/fidelityfx_sdk/fidelityfx_sdk-page_techniques_contrast-adaptive-sharpening/>`_
  - `FidelityFX Robust Contrast Adaptive Sharpening \(RCAS\) <https://gpuopen.com/manuals/fidelityfx_sdk/fidelityfx_sdk-page_techniques_super-resolution-upscaler/#robust-contrast-adaptive-sharpening-rcas>`_

- **Anti-Aliasing**

  - `Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing \(FXAA\) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_approximate_anti-aliasing>`_
  - `Directionally Localized Anti-Aliasing \(DLAA\) <http://www.and.intercon.ru/releases/talks/dlaagdc2011/>`_

- **Camera effects:** Autoexposure, Dual-Kawase bloom, lens effect, and vignette.
- **Color conversions:** Chromaticity space, polar coordinate space, and grayscale.
- **Local Normalization:** Census Transform and Local Contrast Normalization.
- **Convolutions:** Gaussian blur, edge detection, and sharpening.
- **Motion estimation:** Hierarchical Lucas-Kanade optical flow.
- **Post-processing:** Backbuffer blending and letterbox.
- **Video effects:** Datamoshing, motion blur, and vector lines.

ReadShade
"""""""""

:Date: 2024 - Present
:Link: https://github.com/ReadShade/ReadShade

I launched a documentation site for ReShade-related support using MkDocs and collaborated with Depth3D to create a documentation site.

PythonicEngine
""""""""""""""

:Date: 2023
:Link: https://github.com/papadanku/PythonicEngine

I spent a weekend in 2023 following `Coder Space's Python 3D Engine Series <https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi77irUVkDav8GLrZSVZiPPHvVa-RjJ-o>`_ and learned about:

- Adding geometry, basic lighting, and a camera to a scene
- Best practices: mipmapping, gamma-correction, and code refactoring
- Fundamentals of the OpenGL pipeline
- Using PyGame, ModernGL, and PyGLM to make an engine
- Differences between Vertex Buffer Objects \(VBOs\) and Vertex Array Objects \(VAOs\)

I also learned about code refactoring through polymorphism, creating a skybox, plane-based skyboxing, and smooth shadowmapping, and used Sphinx to generate documentation for the project.
